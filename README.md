## Predictive Analysis of Stock Market Trends

With a worldwide pandemic and the economy in shambles, we wanted to see if we're able to help uncertain people in an uncertain world survive through the tough times ahead of us. What better way to assist the people in need than to help guide them in the right direction to intelligently select which stocks to invest in?

The basis of this project is to see if we are able to create a machine learning model to predict the future for stock market prices. To test the accuracy of the model, we will select a company's stock within a period of time. From there, we trained the model with 20 years worth of data. After that, we tested to see if it's able to work to predict future stock prices.

After all this, just how accurate can an AI predict the future stock prices?
